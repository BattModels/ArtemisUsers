## Acknowledgement in Publications

All publications resulting from the usage of Artemis should include an acknowledgement.
We recommend the following text:

## Maintenance

Artemis will be taken offline for periodic updates, maintenance, and upgrades. Users will be notified for the maintenance information [here](https://arc.umich.edu/tag/maintenance/) or via [email](arc-support@umich.edu). 

We intend to keep Artemis up for as much time as possible. However, planned
periodic downtime for maintenance will likely improve total uptime and user
experience by catching and fixing issues before they become disruptive.
