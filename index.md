## Maintenance

Arjuna will be taken offline for periodic updates, maintenance, and upgrades. We
will provide at least two week's notice via the
[list-serve](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/arjuna-users)
and via the login message on Arjuna.

- Summary of Planned Activities
- Expected Duration
- Mitigation steps (if any) users may need to take

We intend to keep Arjuna up for as much time as possible. However, planned
periodic downtime for maintenance will likely improve total uptime and user
experience by catching and fixing issues before they become disruptive.

## Emails from the Admin Team

The [Arjuna List Serve](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/arjuna-users)
is used to provide important information regarding planned maintenance, service
interruptions or changes in policy. Users are strongly encouraged to subscribe to
